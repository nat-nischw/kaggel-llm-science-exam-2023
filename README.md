## Overall
<img src="asset/simple_pipeline.png" width="1200" height="400">

In the Kaggle competition, we are not able to unlock certain features because Kaggle's environment does not support them. Therefore, we choose to use some cases for testing and submit them to see the momentum on the Leaderboard. This is one of the methods supported on the Kaggle environment. We might refer to the technique as RAG, which is available in the advanced system in tier-3.
